        description: "The project, showcased in the Zindi Hackathon 2023 Advanced Category, revolved around developing an RL agent proficient in solving a Rubik's cube. The selected approach involved implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a cutting-edge on-policy RL method pioneered by OpenAI, utilizing Python and deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow. Meticulously fine-tuning the model's performance, an exhaustive exploration of hyperparameters was undertaken, iteratively refining the model to achieve remarkable results. These systematic efforts led to significant advancements in both the accuracy and efficiency of the agent, clearly demonstrating its prowess in successfully tackling the Rubik's cube challenge.",
